# Tic-Tae-Toe

* I have created a game and the name of game is Tic Tac Toe (Zero, Katta in Hindi).

* Rules of the game
    * The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
    * You are X, your friend is O.
    * The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
    * When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If nobody wins, it is a draw.
* This is very interesting game if you play.
* This game UI is fully responsive so you can enjoy in any device.
